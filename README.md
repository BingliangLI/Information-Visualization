# Abstract & What is this about?

This project is about using Python to **easily create detailed and beautiful box plots** based on Matplotlib. 

There are three types of plots that provided by this project:  

- `info_boxplot` : A regular box plot, but also capable of drawing twentieth quantile lines inside the box.
- `hist_box` : This plot is a mix with a box plot(with `bin = 10`) on the left side and a histogram on the right side.
- `creative_boxplot` : This plot is a mix with a box plot on the left side and a modified distribution plot on the right side.
